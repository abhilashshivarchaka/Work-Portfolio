## About the project:
The main objective of this project is to provide an online platform for connecting farmers and customers where customers can purchase goods from farmers.

## Description:
* The Farmer Customer Connect is a web application and an E-Commerce website which can be used by both farmers and customers to buy and sell vegetables, dairy products, fruits etc. 
* In this Web application farmers can register themselves and sell their produce at a suitable price. 
* Customers can also buy various vegetables, dairy products, and fruits from their home for a nominal price. 
* This Web application connects both farmer’s and customer’s digitally making it easier for farmers to sell their products at ease without any intermediate buyers. 
* This Web application mainly aims to remove the middlemen so that the farmer’s can sell their products at a suitable price.



## Problem facing till now:
* We had a little problem with the implementation of Google authentication.
* We faced a few problems related to posting and fetching data to and from the database, but we could solve the issues by going through various online resources.




## Technologies that we are learning:
* Frontend
* React
* Backend
* Node, Express and Mongodb


## Testing tool:
* Jest

## Code Versioning Systems:
* Git and GitHub


## During Sprint 1...
*  we learnt about scrum processes and agile methodology. Also, we came to know about the technologies (MERN - MongoDB, Express, React JS and Node JS) that have to be used to complete the project. 
* We learnt how to create and use Git repositories and branches.  
* We started to create a database and created a sample database to know about how databases work.

## During Sprint 2 ...
* We were split into two teams and my team was given the task of login users using Google authentication. 
* We worked for 2 days for Google authentication and then we split again into two teams. 
* One team worked on the general login process and the other worked on the google ones. I was in charge of google authentication. 
* The difficulty I faced is in our designing part we were asked to retrieve data from a radio which separates the user from google generated information which made us a difficult task.

## During Sprint 3...
* My team started working on the farmer’s login and log out page where a user with type farmer is able to register their credentials and login to their respective pages.
* The login needs to be done with JWT authentication where a token is developed using an algorithm. 
* We generated the page but not able to redirect the user

## During Sprint 4...
* My team started working on redirecting the farmer’s page to the farmer page and then the customer to the customer page. 
* We had bugs which are to be fixed. We also fixed bugs in that. So as of now, we were ready to redirect the page to the respective user.
* Now the process is to test each and every component of the frontend and backend.
